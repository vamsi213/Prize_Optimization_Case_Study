# Prize_Optimization_Case_Study
Price optimization is a strategic approach that uses data analysis and modelling to determine the optimal pricing of products or services. This process involves considering various factors, including market demand, competition, costs, and customer behaviour, to set prices that maximize profitability and market share. 

## Overview
This project explores the use of data analysis and modeling techniques to optimize product pricing. The objective is to understand how different pricing strategies affect sales and profitability, and to implement a dynamic pricing model that adjusts prices based on customer segments.

## Data
The project uses a dataset named Competition_Data.csv, which contains information on product prices, competition prices, sales amounts, and quantities sold over time.

## Steps Involved
- **Data Exploration**: Loaded the pricing data and performed an initial exploration to understand the structure and contents of the dataset.
- **Price Distribution Analysis**: Visualized the distribution of prices for both our store and the competition using histograms.
- **Price vs. Sales Analysis**: Analyzed the relationship between price and sales amount for both our store and the competition using scatter plots.
- **Weekly Price Trends**: Tracked and visualized weekly price trends for our store and the competition to identify any patterns.
- **Price Elasticity Calculation**: Calculated the price elasticity of demand to measure the sensitivity of quantity sold to changes in price.
- **Sales Summary**: Summarized total sales amounts and quantities sold for both our store and the competition. 
- **Sales by Price Bracket**: Analyzed sales performance by categorizing prices into different brackets and comparing sales amounts across these brackets.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Segmented items based on their average prices into "Low," "Medium," and "High" segments. Calculated the price elasticity for each segment.
- **Dynamic Pricing Simulation**: Simulated a dynamic pricing strategy where prices are adjusted based on customer segments. Compared the impact on total sales amount and quantity sold against the existing pricing strategy.


## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **SciPy**: Optimization algorithms.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models (if applicable).

## Results
**Price Distribution**: Provided insights into how prices are distributed and how they compare with competitors.
**Price vs. Sales**: Demonstrated the impact of pricing on sales performance.
**Elasticity Analysis**: Showed how different segments of products respond to price changes.
**Dynamic Pricing**: The simulation indicated potential changes in sales performance with the implementation of dynamic pricing.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of strategic pricing in maximizing sales and profitability. By understanding price elasticity and implementing dynamic pricing strategies, businesses can better align their prices with market demand and customer behavior.

## Dependencies:
Python 3.x
pandas
matplotlib

## Future Work
- Further refinement of the dynamic pricing model by incorporating additional factors such as seasonality and promotions.
- Integration of machine learning algorithms for more accurate price predictions.
